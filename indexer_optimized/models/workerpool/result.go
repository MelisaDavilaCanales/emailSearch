// Result is a generic type that encapsulates the result of a task execution.
// It holds the output value and an error, providing a way to safely return both.
// So that the user of this result can handle both success and error cases.
//
// Fields:
//   - Value: Contains the result value generated by the task when it completes successfully. It's of "Output" type.
//   - Err: An error value that indicates if any error occurred during the task execution.
